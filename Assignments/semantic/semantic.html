                <h2>Earliest Inhabitants</h2>

                <p>The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around 9200 BC, based on evidence found throughout
                    the area
                    and especially at the much-studied Gault Archeological Site, north of the city.</p>

                <h2>Native Peoples</h2>

                <p>When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also
                    traveled in the region. Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions, few
                    settlements
                    were established for several centuries.</p>

                <h2>Geographic Distinction</h2>

                <p>Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long stable and inactive fault line, on
                    the
                    Colorado River. This fault divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie land to
                    the East.
